          <p class="para-content">
            Cat-eye glasses for round faces are a timeless and stylish choice of eyewear, one that can highlight the cheekbones and lift the face. A cat-eye glasses frame for a round face, describes a pair of glasses that have a sharp and feline looking design. The upswept corners are designed to mimic that of a cat.

            A cat-eye glasses shape for a round face are designed to bring attention to the upper portion of the face, working to give the face more balance and structure. A rounded face is equally proportioned, circular in shape with very few contours or areas of definition. The pointed upper corners of a cat-eye frame shape lift the top half of the face, drawing away from rounder cheeks. Cat-eye frames help to lengthen and thin out the rounded, more circular proportions of the face.

          <p class="para-content">
            Cat-eye glasses are a classic style of glasses frame. A staple in the fashion world since the 1930s, cat-eye glasses are considered a representation of old Hollywood glamour. However, despite being a big fashion item, cat-eye glasses  work with a casual look just as much as an evening look, moving effortlessly from day to night. Cat-eye glasses bring an edge of glamour to a winter look or add a bold flair to a summer look.

          <p class="para-content">
            Cat-eye glasses may traditionally be considered a more feminine frame shape, however, they work to complement any face, whether more masculine, feminine or gender neutral. Cat-eye glasses for men with a round face help to bring attention to the browline and give a rounded face more structure.Cat-eye glasses for women with a round face lift the brow area and highlight the eyes.

          <h3 class="subtitle">Browline Glasses for a Round Face</h3>
          <p class="para-content">
            Browline glasses for a round face shape are a bold and classic eyewear choice, bringing focus to the upper brow area and lengthening a round face. A browline glasses frame for a round face, refers to a type of glasses in which the top half of the rim surrounding the lens, known as the browline or top rim, are darker than the rest of the rim surrounding the lenses.

          </p>

          <p class="para-content">
            Browline glasses are a good choice of eyewear for round faces as they are designed to replicate the browline, lift the cheeks and bring some shape to the face. A round face has a similar length and width, giving the face a wide look, lacking sharp structure or definition. A browline glasses frame brings attention to the upper portion of the face. This helps to change the proportion of a round face shape by lifting the cheeks and creating the illusion of a lengthened and thinner face. 

          </p>

          <p class="para-content">
            Browline glasses are a classic style of eyewear, dating back to the 50s and 60s. Though their popularity has fluctuated, browline glasses are currently a favourite for those who enjoy a combination of retro and modern fashion. Their simple design makes them a good choice for a casual, everyday look, in the office, with the potential to transition into a formal night time event. A browline glasses shape for a round face, help bring some sophistication to a fun summer look, or complement a more neutral winter outfit.

          </p>
          <p class="para-content">
            Browline glasses are a gender neutral frame suitable for all people, whether the face is more masculine or feminine presenting. Browline glasses for men with a round face work to bring structure and shape to a face by highlighting the top portion of the face, in the same way browline glasses for women with a round face work to contour and highlight the same area.

          <h3 class="subtitle">Full Rimmed Glasses for a Round Face</h3>
          <p class="para-content">
            Full rimmed glasses for a round face are a popular choice as they help bring strong angles and lines to a circular face. A full rimmed glasses frame for a round face, describes a pair of glasses that have a lens rim that is completely surrounded by the material of the frame. The material of a full rimmed glasses frame may be metal, polycarbonate or plastic. Full rimmed glasses are one of the most popular frame types in eye wear. They are a sturdy and durable choice that provide a bold fashion statement. 

          </p>

          <p class="para-content">
            Full rimmed glasses for round faces are designed to draw attention to the upper portion of the face, and balance out the structure of the face. Round faces are fuller looking in the cheeks. The cheekbones are wider looking and the overall shape of the face is very circular, with equal proportions for the length and width. The flowing, continuous lines and bold angles of a full rimmed frame help bring attention to the upper portion of the face. By doing this, full rimmed frames help to balance out the proportions of a round face, making it appear longer and thinner, helping to sharpen and define the facial features. 

          </p>

          <p class="para-content">
            Full rimmed glasses are a classic frame shape, enduring in its popularity. Though the thicker, chunkier frame may be a good statement piece for a night out, full rimmed glasses work well as a casual piece, helping to bring some fashion to an understated look. Full rimmed glasses are wearable in both the summer and winter seasons. You could pick a bright colour for your full rimmed frame to complement a fun summer look, or pick a neutral shade to add a touch of sophistication to the winter look.

          </p>
          <p class="para-content">
            Full rimmed glasses are suitable for all people, whether you have masculine or feminine features. Full rimmed glasses for men with a round face work to bring attention to the upper portion of the face, highlighting the browline and giving structure. Full rimmed glasses for women with a round face achieve a similar effect, bringing attention to this upper portion of the face, lifting the cheeks and providing a lengthening effect.

      <h3 class="subtitle">What are the Best Glasses Colors for Round Faces?</h3 class>
      <p class="para-content">
        The best glasses colours for a round face are those that are darker,
        such as black, grey, and darker shades of blue and green, as these help
        to draw attention to the glasses and the areas they are trying to
        emphasise.The main things to consider when picking glasses for a round
        face is that the frame enhances the features, elongate the face and
        provides structure. Rectangle, square, geometric cat-eye, browline and
        full rimmed are the best frame shapes to do this and the colour that
        they come in further enhances these effects.
      </p>
      <p class="para-content">
        Generally speaking, darker colours are the best for glasses being worn
        on a round face. A lighter colour generally blends into the face, and
        contributes to the softer, rounded, less defined features of a round
        face. Rectangle, square, geometric cat-eye, browline and full rimmed
        frames have angles and bold lines which darker colours help to amplify.
        Black, brown, grey, and darker shades of blue and green coloured frames,
        will help to create contrast and definition in a round face.
      </p>
      <p class="para-content">
        The benefit of darker colours being the best glasses colour for a round
        face, is that there are many colour options for all people. These
        colours work for men and women with a round face, both a more feminine
        or masculine look.
      </p>
      <p class="para-content">
        Other considerations when picking a glasses colour for a diamond face
        shape is skin tone, hair colour and eye colour, as these can affect how
        a pair of glasses will look on each individual person. It is important
        to remember however, that these are only suggestions. You should express
        your personal style and individuality with whatever colour you like
        best.

      <p class="para-content">
        The best sunglasses for round faces are square, browline, cat-eye and
        geometric sunglasses as they help to bring structure to the face, whilst
        also protecting your eyes and providing a fashion statement. The best
        sunglasses for round faces differ slightly from the best optical glasses
        for round faces, as sunglasses are worn for a different reason than
        optical glasses. The best sunglasses for a round face are those that
        cover a wide area of the eye, to help protect the eye from the sun and
        UV rays, whilst also bringing a fashionable edge to a look. The best
        sunglasses for a round face shape are listed below.

          <p class="grid-text">Browline sunglasses are beneficial for round
            faces as they bring attention to the upper portion of the face,
            helping to lift the cheekbones, whilst bringing a sophisticated look
            to your outfit. The lens shape also gives good eye coverage and helps
            protect your eyes from the sun.</p>

          <p class="grid-text">Cat-eye sunglasses are a popular sunglasses frame
            shape for people with a round face as they contour the face and bring
            a stylish edge to a look. The sharp, elongated lens helps to protect

          <h5 class="grid-title">Geometric sunglasses</h5>
          <p class="grid-text">Geometric sunglasses come in many shapes from a
            pentagon, hexagon and octagon. They are a fun way to bring some shape
            to a rounder face, and the wider lenses help protect your eyes from
            the sun.</p>

      <p class="para-content">
        The colour of sunglasses for a rounder face is just as important a
        consideration as the colour of your optical glasses and both follow the
        same suggestions. Darker sunglasses colours, like browns, blacks and
        greys, are a good option for those with a rounder face as they help to
        make the sunglasses stand out on the face and emphasise their enhancing
        and contouring qualities.
      </p>
      <p class="para-content">
        Cat-eye sunglasses are generally a more feminine frame, however,
        cat-eye, geometric, square and browline glasses are popular for all
        people, men and women. All of these frame shapes work with a more
        masculine or more feminine look, helping to elongate any face, define
        the features and provide good coverage for protection from the sun.

      <h3 class="subtitle">What are the Glasses that are not good for Round Face Shape?</h3>
      <p class="para-content">
        Glasses that are not a good choice for round face shapes are round,
        oval, aviator and undersized glasses as these glasses can add curves and
        fullness to a round face. The glasses that are not suitable for round
        faces and the reasoning for this are as listed below.
      </p>
      <ul class="unordered-list">
        <li>
         <span class="list-title"> Round glasses:</span> Round glasses are not recommended for a round face
          shape as they make the face appear more circular and can add curves.
          They will not contour the face and could make it look shorter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Oval glasses:</span> Like circle glasses, oval glasses are not a great choice
          of frame shape for round faces as they add to the fullness and
          circular shape of a round face.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Aviator glasses:</span> Aviator glasses have a tear-drop, circular lens. This
          lens may not complement a round face as it will add curves and
          emphasise the fullness in the cheeks and wide cheekbones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Undersized glasses:</span> An undersized glasses frame for a round face is
          not an ideal choice as it can make the face look wider and emphasise
          the fullness.

      <h3 class="subtitle">How to Understand whether you have a Round face or not?</h3>
      <p class="para-content">
        To find out whether or not a person has a round face or not, the face
        needs to be measured and the shape of the facial features considered. To
        find out the shape of a face when measuring it, there are four main
        areas to estimate; the forehead, the cheekbones, the jaw line and the
        length of the face from chin to hairline. If the measurements across the
        face are somewhat equal to the measurements from chin to hairline, it is
        likely that the face is round. It is a good idea to consider the other
        defining characteristics of a round face when making this assessment. A
        round face may have softer, less defined features such as a soft jaw and
        nose. A round face may have full cheeks and wider cheekbones.

        <div class="flex-left">
      <h3 class="sub-list-title">
        To determine if you have a round face you should do the following.
      </h3>
      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          Measure the length of your face: Take a measuring tool like a tape
          measure and estimate the length of your face from the tip of the chin
          to the centre of the hairline.
        </li>
        <li>
          Measure the width of your face: Take the same tool and measure across
          the forehead. Do the same for the jawline and the cheekbones.If all of
          these measurements are around the same, it may be an indication that
          you have a round face.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should next consider the defining characteristics of a round face
          and if you may have them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider: Is your face circular, are the features soft, is your
          jawline rounded and less defined, do you have a fullness in the
          cheeks. If the answer to these questions are yes, it is likely that
          you have a round face.

      <h3 class="subtitle">How to Choose Best Glasses for Different Face Shapes?</h3>
      <p class="para-content">
        Choosing the best glasses for different face shapes, revolves around
        picking a frame that accentuates the facial features and complements the
        unique characteristics of that face shape. Like round faces, other face
        shapes such as oval and diamond have a certain frame shape that works
        best with the defining features and ratios of the shape.
      </p>
      <p class="para-content">
        Once someone has determined what face shape they have, they know what
        areas need to be highlighted and balanced, contoured or shaped and can
        pick a frame that works accordingly.
      </p>
      <ol class="ordered-list hightlight-list">
        <li>
          Pick a frame shape that highlights areas that need to be brought
          forwards or lifted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose a glasses frame that balances the proportions of your face.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pick a frame colour that helps emphasise the enhancing features of
          your glasses.

        What are the other accessories for Round Faces along with Glasses?
      </h3>
      <p class="para-content">
        There are a range of accessories that are suitable for round faces,
        along with glasses, including jewellery and hair accessories. Glasses
        for a round face will help to lengthen and thin out the roundness, which
        is the same aim when picking accessories. For jewellery based
        accessories, people with round faces want to pick earrings and necklaces
        that are longer, helping to give a lengthening look to the face. Hair
        accessories for people with a round face should have something in the
        middle to pull focus, such as a knot or accent piece, helping to
        lengthen a rounder face.

      <p class="para-content">
        There are many types of face shapes besides round, each with their own
        most suitable and complementary frame shapes.There are four other face
        shapes besides round. The best glasses for these face shapes are listed
        below.
      </p>
      <ol class="ordered-list">
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Oval:</span> An oval face shape is similar to a round face in that it has no
          hard lines and sharp features. An oval face shape has wide cheekbones,
          with the width of the forehead and chin smaller than the cheekbones.
          The best glasses for an oval face shape are square, rectangle and
          cat-eye, as they bring some angles and contour to a rounder face.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Pear-shaped:</span> A pear shaped face generally has a wide jaw, with the
          forehead and cheeks more narrow. The best glasses for a pear-shaped
          face are cat-eye glasses, square glasses and round glasses as they
          help to contrast with the softer features of a pear shaped face,
          adding some shape and contour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Square:</span> Square shaped faces have a forehead and jawline that are
          similar widths, with few curves throughout the face. The best glasses
          for a square face are round or circular, oval and cat-eye as the curve
          in these frame shapes contrast the harsh lines of a square face and
          bring some softness to the features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-title">Diamond:</span> Diamond faces are defined by a narrow forehead, prominent
          cheekbones and a narrow chin. Oval, cat-eye and aviator style glasses
          are the best glasses for a diamond face shape as they add some curve
          and softness to the face.
