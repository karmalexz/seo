            A round shaped face is identified by its circular, softer,
            characteristics, including smooth lines, full cheeks and wide
            cheekbones. With a round shaped face, the length of the face is
            approximately equal to the width of the face. The forehead and
            jawline are likely to measure the same and the hairline is wider
            than most other face shapes. The frame shapes that are the best fit
            for a round face are the ones that provide angles and strong lines,
            bringing more definition and structure to the face. Round glasses
            for round faces are not recommended as they do not create angles or
            give sharper structure to the face.

            rectangular frame work to break up fullness and circularity. Rounder
            faces have wider cheekbones and a fullness in the cheeks. The length
            and width of the face are around the same measurement, creating
            equal proportions. Rectangular frames give the face some different
            proportions, such as the illusion of a longer and thinner face.
            Rectangle eyeglasses for a round face help to separate the features
            of the rounder face. The fullness and circularity of a round face

            masculine or feminine looking features. Rectangle glasses for men
            with a round face work to cut up some of the equal, full proportions
            and give the face balance. Rectangle glasses for women with a round

            that they lengthen and contour the face. Another advantage of a

            frames, making them an on trend fashion piece all year round. The
            cons of rectangle glasses for a round face, revolve around personal
            style or design preferences, as, in terms of complementing the round

          <h2>Geometric Glasses for a Round Face</h2>
          <p>
            Geometric glasses for a round face are a stylish and fun choice of
            eyewear, as they can help bring interesting angles and dimension to
            a fuller face. Geometric glasses frames for a round face, refer to
            glasses in which the frame around the lenses has many angles, and
            features four or more sides. Geometric glasses come in a variety of
            shapes including pentagon, hexagon, heptagon and octagon. Square and
            rectangle frame shapes may be included within this category.
            Geometric frame shapes are designed to bring angles to round faces,
            in turn providing some shape and structure. The characteristics of a
            round face shape include soft lines and undefined features, wide
            cheekbones and full cheeks. The angles and lines of a geometric
            frame shape contrast against these rounder features and give some
            contour to a face. Geometric glasses help to change the proportions
            of a round face from more circular and round to thinner, with more
            length. Though geometric glasses provide a hint of fun and
            originality to a look with their unique shape, suitable for many
            occasions, formal or casual. Geometric frames are well suited for a
            day look in the office or night out for dinner as they have an
            element of sophistication and intelligence. A A geometric glasses
            shape for a round face, are well suited to both summer and winter
            seasons as their unique style complements a bright summer look, or
            brings flair to a more subdued winter look. Geometric eyeglasses for
            a round face are a gender neutral frame, working to bring angles to
            a face whether more masucline or feminine. Geometric glasses for men
            with a round face work to bring some angles and structure to a face.
            Geometric glasses for women with a round face help to structure and
            balance the face, adding definition to the facial features. The pros
            of geometric glasses for a round face are listed below. One pro of
            geometric glasses is that they accentuate your features and add
            personality to your face. An additional advantage of geometric
            glasses are their versatility suitable for any occasion, through any
            season. The main con of geometric eyeglasses for a round face is
            that the more sides and angles the frame has, like an octagon shape,
            the more geometric glasses will resemble a round or circular frame,
            which is unsuitable for a round face. Circular frames add to the
            curves of a round face, so it is best to stick to a frame with four,
            five or six sides when buying geometric glasses, as these will add
            structure and balance to the face. Put Three Products after every

          <h2>Cat-eye Glasses for a Round Face</h2>
          <p>
            Cat-eye glasses for round faces are a timeless and stylish choice of
            eyewear, one that can highlight the cheekbones and lift the face. A
            cat-eye glasses frame for a round face, describes a pair of glasses
            that have a sharp and feline looking design. The upswept corners are
            designed to mimic that of a cat. A cat-eye glasses shape for a round
            face are designed to bring attention to the upper portion of the
            face, working to give the face more balance and structure. A rounded
            face is equally proportioned, circular in shape with very few
            contours or areas of definition. The pointed upper corners of a
            cat-eye frame shape lift the top half of the face, drawing away from
            rounder cheeks. Cat-eye frames help to lengthen and thin out the
            rounded, more circular proportions of the face. Cat-eye glasses are
            a classic style of glasses frame. A staple in the fashion world
            since the 1930s, cat-eye glasses are considered a representation of
            old Hollywood glamour. However, despite being a big fashion item,
            cat-eye glasses work with a casual look just as much as an evening
            look, moving effortlessly from day to night. Cat-eye glasses bring
            an edge of glamour to a winter look or add a bold flair to a summer
            look. Cat-eye glasses may traditionally be considered a more
            feminine frame shape, however, they work to complement any face,
            whether more masculine, feminine or gender neutral. Cat-eye glasses
            for men with a round face help to bring attention to the browline
            and give a rounded face more structure.Cat-eye glasses for women
            with a round face lift the brow area and highlight the eyes. The
            pros of a cat-eye glasses shape for a round face are listed below.
            One pro of cat-eye glasses is that they highlight the upper half of
            the face. An additional advantage of cat-eye glasses is that they
            are a classic and timeless frame, always in style. The pros of
            cat-eye glasses include their versatility and ability to be worn
            throughout any season, day or night. The cons of cat-eye eyeglasses
            for a round face are their size, as some of these frames can be
            undersized. Undersized frames are not a good choice for a round face
            as they will emphasise the fullness and make the features appear
            wider. Pick a size that is proportionate to your face, when buying
            cat-eyeglasses for a round face. Put Three Products after every

          <h2>Browline Glasses for a Round Face</h2>
          <p>
            Browline glasses for a round face shape are a bold and classic
            eyewear choice, bringing focus to the upper brow area and
            lengthening a round face. A browline glasses frame for a round face,
            refers to a type of glasses in which the top half of the rim
            surrounding the lens, known as the browline or top rim, are darker
            than the rest of the rim surrounding the lenses. Browline glasses
            are a good choice of eyewear for round faces as they are designed to
            replicate the browline, lift the cheeks and bring some shape to the
            face. A round face has a similar length and width, giving the face a
            wide look, lacking sharp structure or definition. A browline glasses
            frame brings attention to the upper portion of the face. This helps
            to change the proportion of a round face shape by lifting the cheeks
            and creating the illusion of a lengthened and thinner face. Browline
            glasses are a classic style of eyewear, dating back to the 50s and
            60s. Though their popularity has fluctuated, browline glasses are
            currently a favourite for those who enjoy a combination of retro and
            modern fashion. Their simple design makes them a good choice for a
            casual, everyday look, in the office, with the potential to
            transition into a formal night time event. A browline glasses shape
            for a round face, help bring some sophistication to a fun summer
            look, or complement a more neutral winter outfit. Browline glasses
            are a gender neutral frame suitable for all people, whether the face
            is more masculine or feminine presenting. Browline glasses for men
            with a round face work to bring structure and shape to a face by
            highlighting the top portion of the face, in the same way browline
            glasses for women with a round face work to contour and highlight
            the same area. The pros of a browline glasses shape for round faces
            are listed below. An advantage of browline glasses is that they
            provide shape and contour to the face, helping to define the
            features. Another pro of browline glasses is that they are a classic
            frame shape, suitable for any season. Browline glasses are
            advantageous as the frame shape works in sunglasses too, the shape
            suitable for both indoor to outdoor wear. The main con of browline
            eyeglasses for a round face is that, whilst the classic 50s looking
            design, may add sophistication to a more youthful face, it may age
            older glasses wearers, making their fashion appear dated. Put Three

          <h2>Full Rimmed Glasses for a Round Face</h2>
          <p>
            Full rimmed glasses for a round face are a popular choice as they
            help bring strong angles and lines to a circular face. A full rimmed
            glasses frame for a round face, describes a pair of glasses that
            have a lens rim that is completely surrounded by the material of the
            frame. The material of a full rimmed glasses frame may be metal,
            polycarbonate or plastic. Full rimmed glasses are one of the most
            popular frame types in eye wear. They are a sturdy and durable
            choice that provide a bold fashion statement. Full rimmed glasses
            for round faces are designed to draw attention to the upper portion
            of the face, and balance out the structure of the face. Round faces
            are fuller looking in the cheeks. The cheekbones are wider looking
            and the overall shape of the face is very circular, with equal
            proportions for the length and width. The flowing, continuous lines
            and bold angles of a full rimmed frame help bring attention to the
            upper portion of the face. By doing this, full rimmed frames help to
            balance out the proportions of a round face, making it appear longer
            and thinner, helping to sharpen and define the facial features. Full
            rimmed glasses are a classic frame shape, enduring in its
            popularity. Though the thicker, chunkier frame may be a good
            statement piece for a night out, full rimmed glasses work well as a
            casual piece, helping to bring some fashion to an understated look.
            Full rimmed glasses are wearable in both the summer and winter
            seasons. You could pick a bright colour for your full rimmed frame
            to complement a fun summer look, or pick a neutral shade to add a
            touch of sophistication to the winter look. Full rimmed glasses are
            suitable for all people, whether you have masculine or feminine
            features. Full rimmed glasses for men with a round face work to
            bring attention to the upper portion of the face, highlighting the
            browline and giving structure. Full rimmed glasses for women with a
            round face achieve a similar effect, bringing attention to this
            upper portion of the face, lifting the cheeks and providing a
            lengthening effect. The pros of full rimmed eyeglasses for round
            faces are listed below. An advantage of full rimmed glasses is that
            they contour and shape the face. Another pro of full rimmed glasses
            is their reliability and durability. An additional advantage of a
            full rimmed glasses shape for a round face, is that they are one of
            the most enduring and popular styles of glasses on the market,
            meaning you always be on top of fashion trends when wearing them.
            The main con of full rimmed glasses for a round face is the weight
            of the frame. Due to the full-bodied, thicker design of a full
            rimmed frame, these glasses can be heavier than most other frames.

          <h2>What are the Best Glasses Colors for Round Faces?</h2>
          <p>
            The best glasses colours for a round face are those that are darker,
            such as black, grey, and darker shades of blue and green, as these
            help to draw attention to the glasses and the areas they are trying
            to emphasise.The main things to consider when picking glasses for a
            round face is that the frame enhances the features, elongate the
            face and provides structure. Rectangle, square, geometric cat-eye,
            browline and full rimmed are the best frame shapes to do this and
            the colour that they come in further enhances these effects.
            Generally speaking, darker colours are the best for glasses being
            worn on a round face. A lighter colour generally blends into the
            face, and contributes to the softer, rounded, less defined features
            of a round face. Rectangle, square, geometric cat-eye, browline and
            full rimmed frames have angles and bold lines which darker colours
            help to amplify. Black, brown, grey, and darker shades of blue and
            green coloured frames, will help to create contrast and definition
            in a round face. The benefit of darker colours being the best
            glasses colour for a round face, is that there are many colour
            options for all people. These colours work for men and women with a
            round face, both a more feminine or masculine look. Other
            considerations when picking a glasses colour for a diamond face
            shape is skin tone, hair colour and eye colour, as these can affect
            how a pair of glasses will look on each individual person. It is
            important to remember however, that these are only suggestions. You
            should express your personal style and individuality with whatever
            colour you like best.
