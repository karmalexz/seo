                services:
              </p>
              <ul>

                <p>
                  No, optometrists are not medical doctors as they have not
                  attended medical school like ophthalmologists. Read more about

                </h3>
                <p>
                  The profession of ophthalmology is different from optometry
                  because it requires a medical degree as ophthalmologists
                  perform surgery.
                  <br /><br />
                  Optometry deals with primary eye care and conditions and
                  anything that is outside the scope of an optometrist, the
                  patient is then referred to an ophthalmologist.

          <ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li>A comprehensive eye examination</li>
